    <h2>Playing Football</h2>
    <p><em>I used to play every Saturday with friends on the local field.</em></p>
    <p>One memory is scoring a last‑minute goal that everyone cheered for.</p>

    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p>I would draw comic characters in the margins of my schoolbooks.</p>
    <p><strong>My favourite</strong> memory is selling a small sketch to my neighbour.</p>

    <h1>Toys</h1>

    <h2>Action Figures</h2>
    <p>I lined them up and created stories for hours on end.</p>
    <p>One time I built a cardboard fortress for them to defend.</p>

    <h2>Building Blocks</h2>
    <p>I loved making tall towers and then carefully rebuilding them.</p>
    <p>My proudest moment was making a bridge that held my toy car.</p>
